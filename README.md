## Introduction

This experiment for my 464 final project is testing the functionality of conducting an
open house using Virtual Reality. You will tour the environment without a headset first then
perform the same tour using an Oculus VR headset (Rift S, Quest, Quest 2). The map represents
a suburban neighborhood built near a forest. In front of you are three explorable house, your
are free to explore the open environment and within the three houses designated by the play
box. The only objective is to explore your environment and the inside of the three houses. The
designated play is depicted in the image below
